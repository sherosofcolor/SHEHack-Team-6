## 💡 Project Overview

> A Work-Life Harmony and Mentorship Ecosystem for Women in Tech

### Inspiration
Our project was inspired by the challenges women in tech face when trying to balance career advancement with personal well-being. We recognized that many professionals struggle with burnout, isolation, and limited access to mentorship opportunities. Hermony was born from our desire to create a supportive ecosystem where women can thrive professionally without sacrificing their personal lives.

### Impact of the Solution
Hermony addresses these challenges through an integrated platform that combines:

1. **Smart Scheduling Technology**: Our app integrates with work calendars and uses intelligent algorithms to identify potential overload situations. By sending "Boundary Alerts" and providing "No-Zone" features, users can protect their personal time while still meeting professional obligations.

2. **Well-Being Monitoring**: The Burnout Tracker monitors work patterns and stress levels using a work-to-personal time ratio methodology. Our research indicates that a ratio above 2.0 correlates with increased burnout symptoms, allowing us to provide timely interventions.

3. **Community Support System**: Through peer-to-peer mentoring and networking features, Hermony breaks down isolation barriers and creates access to guidance from those who have navigated similar challenges.

### Tech Stack Used
- **Frontend**: React, TypeScript, Vite, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Firebase (Authentication, Firestore, Real-time Database)
- **APIs**: Google Calendar API, Dialogflow (for Balance Buddy AI)
- **Analytics**: Custom dashboard for Burnout Tracker visualization

## ⚠ Additional Information

### Challenges Faced
1. **Calendar Integration Complexity**: Integrating with various calendar systems while maintaining privacy presented significant challenges. We solved this by creating a secure middleware layer that only extracts necessary scheduling data without accessing personal details.

2. **Balance Metric Algorithm**: Developing an algorithm that accurately reflects work-life balance was difficult. After multiple iterations and user testing, we created a ratio-based system that provides meaningful insights without being overly simplistic.

3. **Real-time Mentorship Matching**: Creating an efficient system for matching mentors and mentees required sophisticated filtering. We implemented a tag-based system combined with availability windows to overcome this challenge.

### Future Scope
1. **Mobile Applications**: Develop native iOS and Android apps for improved user experience
2. **AI-Enhanced Recommendations**: Expand the Balance Buddy AI capabilities to provide more personalized suggestions
3. **Corporate Partnerships**: Create enterprise solutions for companies looking to support their female employees
4. **International Expansion**: Adapt the platform for various cultural contexts and time zones
5. **Advanced Analytics**: Implement predictive burnout detection using machine learning

### AI Tool Disclosure
- We used ChatGPT and Claude AI to brainstorm feature  ideas and development of the application

## 📊 Work-Life Balance Metrics

Hermony uses a work-to-personal time ratio to help users maintain a healthy balance:
- **Optimal Range**: 1.0 to 1.5 ratio of work to personal time
- **Warning Zone**: 1.5 to 2.0 ratio (mild burnout risk)
- **Danger Zone**: Above 2.0 ratio (significant burnout risk)
